See CHANGELOG

NOTE:  QmailAdmin ~should~ still run like it used to before I
made all these changes, but it has not been tested extensivly.
I see no need to worry about that now as the rip and tear is 
not over, as you can see in TODO.

The following information relates to a large block of changes
that Rick Widmer added right before the final release of 1.2.0.
I built up a large number of changes and will commit them in 
batches, in the same order they were created.

#################################################################

The final (hopefully) update :

Change the version in configure


#################################################################

The final (hopefully) update :

Copy the build system from 1.2.0 final.

Identify all changes from PRE-1 to FINAL and make sure they are
all in 1.3.0.  

  alias.c
    Delete duplicated  #include <unistd.h>
    Delete invalid fclose about line 117

  auth.c
    Check HAS_PW_FLAGS about line 155

  autorespond.c
    strreplace(addr, ':', '.') about line 89

  qmailadmin.c
    undef PACKAGE_*

  template.c
    undef PACKAGE_*
    add comment to ##z
    make value static in get_session_val

  user.c
    undef PACKAGE_*
    substantial changes to update_user_info

  util.c
    add warning about memory leak in get_html_text()
    make tmpbuf static in get_color_text
    make tmpbuf static in get_quota_used



#################################################################

Changes from  040116 :

Replace  vclose(); exit(0); with return() so everything returns
to the caller and passes back a status value.  DO NOT exit before
painting the footer.html file.  The return value is often the
index into the lang/ file to retrieve the status message.

Changes to the auth code, including moving session file handling
from qmailadmin.c to auth.c.

Move the GetValues from command.c to qmailadmin.c so they are 
only done once.

Change ADMIN type values so they can be used with < and > rather
than checking ==  or != on each.

Move processing header.html and footer.html to qmailadmin.c
instead of having send_template() and send_template_now().
Remove send_template, rename send_template_now to send_template,
and change all calls to send_template_now() to send_template().
Remember... we ALWAYS return on failure, and header.html and 
footer.html will ALWAYS be processed.







#################################################################

Changes from  040109 :

Change from global TmpBuf* to function local Buffer*

Start using more parms instead of globals.

Remove some authentication checking deep within the program
because the limits will be enforced in command.c instead.


#################################################################

Changes from  040108 :

Remove show_aliases from alias.c.  (obsolete)

Clear the buffer in show_dotqmail_lines.

Remove showaliases and showcouts from command.c.  (obsolete)

Remove /open/ case from qmailadmin.c.  (obsolete)

Remove ##r from template.c.

Remove some debug from util.c.

Make check for mailing lists more specific in count_stuff 
function of util.c.


#################################################################

Changes from  040107 :

Move all use of global TmpBuf* to function local Buffer*.

Move as much HTML as possible out of c into templates.

Don't pass so much stuff to QmailButton.  Much of this will 
be moved to the session file.  For now use global variables.

Replace  vclose();  exit(0);  with return() so the program can
ALWAYS call header and footer.

Replace all calls to count_*() and load_limits() with a single
call to count_stuff().

Increase efficiency of reading Autoresponder Message File by making
the file static, and adding a flag that tells if it is properly 
set to read the actual text.  (This will usually happen.)

Change various field names that are passed from fields that end up 
in the moduser variable.  All become modu.  Old values include: 
moduser, deluser, maybe others.

Re-order a number of variable declarations in qmailadmin.c so they 
match the order and spacing in qmailadminx.h.

Send errors the sys admin might be interested in to error_log. 
(stderr)

Move 'F' code from template.c to autorespond.c

Delete obsolete template tags: b, f, h, l, m, n, O 

Add new tags: u - stuff for single line templates 
              W - common variables to add to a URL

Drastic changes to check_mailbox_flags so it only reads the
.qmail file once.

Provide tags for ##t with the opposite meaning.  For example
##th is skipped if HELP is not defined.  I have added ##tH that
is skipped if HELP is defined.  h and H have opposite meanings.

Move much of the function of V into a template file - version.html
