See CHANGELOG

NOTE:  QmailAdmin 1.3.0 may not run properly...  I still have 
more changes to add!

The following information relates to a large block of changes
that Rick Widmer added right before the final release of 1.2.0.
I built up a large number of changes and will commit them in 
batches, in the same order they were created.


#################################################################

Changes from  040109 :

Change from global TmpBuf* to function local Buffer*

Start using more parms instead of globals.

Remove some authentication checking deep within the program
because the limits will be enforced in command.c instead.


#################################################################

Changes from  040108 :

Remove show_aliases from alias.c.  (obsolete)

Clear the buffer in show_dotqmail_lines.

Remove showaliases and showcouts from command.c.  (obsolete)

Remove /open/ case from qmailadmin.c.  (obsolete)

Remove ##r from template.c.

Remove some debug from util.c.

Make check for mailing lists more specific in count_stuff 
function of util.c.


#################################################################

Changes from  040107 :

Move all use of global TmpBuf* to function local Buffer*.

Move as much HTML as possible out of c into templates.

Don't pass so much stuff to QmailButton.  Much of this will 
be moved to the session file.  For now use global variables.

Replace  vclose();  exit(0);  with return() so the program can
ALWAYS call header and footer.

Replace all calls to count_*() and load_limits() with a single
call to count_stuff().

Increase efficiency of reading Autoresponder Message File by making
the file static, and adding a flag that tells if it is properly 
set to read the actual text.  (This will usually happen.)

Change various field names that are passed from fields that end up 
in the moduser variable.  All become modu.  Old values include: 
moduser, deluser, maybe others.

Re-order a number of variable declarations in qmailadmin.c so they 
match the order and spacing in qmailadminx.h.

Send errors the sys admin might be interested in to error_log. 
(stderr)

Move 'F' code from template.c to autorespond.c

Delete obsolete template tags: b, f, h, l, m, n, O 

Add new tags: u - stuff for single line templates 
              W - common variables to add to a URL

Drastic changes to check_mailbox_flags so it only reads the
.qmail file once.

Provide tags for ##t with the opposite meaning.  For example
##th is skipped if HELP is not defined.  I have added ##tH that
is skipped if HELP is defined.  h and H have opposite meanings.

Move much of the function of V into a template file - version.html
