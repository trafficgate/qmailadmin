Rick's todo list:

Add jump to first field javascript to templates.

TMDA checkbox.

CSS support in templates.

Look through archives for other todo items, and add them
to this list.

Verify we are actually using the latest build system, and that
all patches have been added.  Check for patches between RC1 and
final, and verify they exist in new code.

Eliminate as many global variables as possible.

Move session handling from time based to a MD5 hash of some
random data.  Move the session files into a single directory
and store login credentials of the current user in the
session file.

Restructure form handling so each edit page uses the following
structure, and put it in its own file named for the .html file
it displays, and the menu choice that calls it.

--------------------------------------------------------------

if( button not clicked ) {

  Get data from mail system
  Set 'error' - 

} else {

  Get data from form            //  GetValue()s  

  Check for errors
}


if( no errors ) {

    update mail system
    send Location: header to next screen
    
} else {

   Paint template

}
    

--------------------------------------------------------------

Consider list instead of menu on first page.

1) issues with mailing list management

Question I got from one tester:
    "is the 'owner' of a list the moderator?"

(my postmasters don't know what owner means on the "create mailing list
page.  Is there a formal "owner" concept in ezmlm?  a little more text here
to clarify would be good).

The interface to modifying the mailing list is better than the old version,
but still a bit clunky.  "show subscribers"  and "show moderators" pages
would be more useful with "add subscribers" and "add moderators" boxes or
buttons on the pages -- in fact, it would less cluttered if the "delete/add
subscriber" and "delete/add moderator" choices _only_ appeared when you did
a "show moderator".  I don't know how useful others find these short cuts
to these functions, however.

2) It's not clear what a "catchall" account is -- and the interface for
creating it is misleading.   The "button" is used here as a radio button,
while all the delete and add buttons actually take you to a new page.  This
is disconcerting to the novice postmaster.

3) For pages which have tables which could conceivably grow large,
navigation should be at the top as well as the bottom (e.g. "add new
forward", "Main menu", etc. along the bottom of the forward/alias accounts
page should also appear along the top).

4) This is probably outside the scope of this tool, but there is no way
I've found to list all possible domains on the server (perhaps even
including the domainname as a pulldown menu on the login page would solve
my craving for context.  If you have any suggestions, I'd appreciate
hearing them.
